# html-sass-js-template

Basic front-end template.

Use this command to watch changes in .scss files and generate/update CSS file (SASS compiler must be installed):
  cmd: "sass --watch sass:css"

Primary and secondary colors can be easily changed in '_themes.scss' file. Choose $primary-color and $secondary-color of your choice and the remaining lighter and darker versions of those colors will be created.

Colors are compiled as css properties, so that they can be easily targeted with JavaScript if needed.
